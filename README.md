Author: Alex Huang (whuang288@wisc.edu), Xizheng Yu (xyu354@wisc.edu)

We are trying to use computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures. To be more specific, we are interested in implementing a neural network that can distinguish American sign language, and hopefully achieve real-time translation. Please check out our website (https://whuang288alex.github.io/sign_language/) for a more detailed introduction.
